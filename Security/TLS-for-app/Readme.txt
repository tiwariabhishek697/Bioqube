Implementation:
Use Cert-Manager to automatically provision and manage TLS certificates.
Configure an Ingress resource to use the TLS certificates.
Steps to Implement TLS with Cert-Manager:

Install Cert-Manager:
bash
Copy Code
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.12.0/cert-manager.yaml
